# [PROGRAMING BASIC WITH JAVA](https://softuni.bg/trainings/1873/programming-basics-with-java-february-2018#lesson-7497)
## :large_blue_diamond: ABOUT THE COURSE: ##

The **"Programming Basics"** course provides the initial programming skills required for all of the technological majors at the [SoftUni](https://softuni.org/). This includes basic codeing skills, working with development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, console handling (reading input and output printing), using the conditional constructions (if, if-else) and cycles (for, while, do-while).

The course ends with a practical programming exam, which is accepted in the [Software engineering program](https://softuni.bg/curriculum) of the [SoftUni](https://softuni.org/).
